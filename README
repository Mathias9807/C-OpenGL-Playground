C-OpenGL-Playground

Compile:
	The source files that need to be compiled are: 
		· Every file that starts with g_
		· Every file that starts with v_
		· One file that starts with sys_

	The sys_*.c file holds platform dependant functions. In theory it can be rewritten to make the program run on anything that at least supports OpenGL. 
	
Dependecies:
	The project uses GLEW and the Open Asset Import Library (Assimp). By default it uses SDL2 for platform specific tasks such as opening a window.
