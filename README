C-OpenGL-Playground

Compile:
	The source files that need to be compiled are: 
		· def.c
		· cvar.c
		· Every file that starts with g_
		· Every file that starts with v_
		· One file that starts with sys_

	The sys_*.c file holds platform dependant functions. In theory it can be rewritten to make the program run on anything that at least supports OpenGL. 
	
Dependecies:
	The project uses GLEW, the lua libraries and the Open Asset Import Library (Assimp). By default it uses SDL2 for platform specific tasks such as opening a window. 

Scripts:
	NEW: dawik (https://github.com/dawik) wrote a  linux makefile for this project! 
	
	The project contains two compilation scripts. 'wincompile.bat' requires gcc to be installed and pointed to by the PATH variable. 'compile' only works on Mac OS X machines with SDL2.framework installed currently but can easily be modified to compile for *nix in general, just modify the LIBS variable in the script to point to where the libraries are stored. I may simplify the compilation process in the future.
